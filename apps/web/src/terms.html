Site.</p>
<p>

unforeseen circumstances or to causes beyond its reasonable control,
including but not limited to: acts of nature, such as fire, flood,
earthquakes, hurricanes, tropical storms or other natural disasters;
war, riot, arson, embargoes, acts of civil or military authority, or
terrorism; fiber cuts; strikes, or shortages in transportation,

registration and use of the Site is a material breach of this Agreement,
which will damage Spundhan Because it is difficult to ascertain the
amount of damages, it is hereby agreed that the sum of $25,000 shall

submit false and/or incomplete information. This shall be in addition to
any other remedies that may be available hereunder or by law.</p>
<p>
<h3>RIGHTS TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</h3>

Both parties acknowledge that remedies at law may be inadequate to
provide an aggrieved party with full compensation in the event of the
other party's breach, and that an aggrieved party shall therefore be
entitled to seek injunctive relief in the event of any such breach, in
addition to seeking all other remedies available at law or in equity.</p>
<p>
<h3>ASSIGNMENT</h3>

The rights and liabilities of the parties hereto will bind and inure to
the benefit of their respective assignees, successors, executors, and
administrators, as the case may be. Neither these Terms and Conditions
nor any rights granted hereunder may be sold, leased, assigned or
otherwise transferred, in whole or in part by you.</p>
<p>
<h3>SEVERABILITY</h3>

If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator
finds any provision of these Terms and Conditions, or any portion
thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the
maximum extent permissible and the remainder of these Terms and
Conditions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p>
<h3>ATTORNEYS FEES</h3>

In the event of any litigation arising out of this agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to attorney's fees and costs in
addition to such other damages as may be awarded by the court.</p>
<p>
